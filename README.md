## Deployment Link

This repository is not deployed independently. It's an integral part of the One Piece Orchard project, and you can access it through the frontend deployment link provided in the frontend repository.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay experience.
- High score tracking.
- Sound effects for interactions.

## Installation

To run the backend code locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AishaA14/one-piece-orchard-backend.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd one-piece-orchard-backend

Install dependencies: npm install

Create a .env file and set your environment variables.

Start the server: npm start

## Timeframe & Working Team

This project was completed within a week, working independently. 

## Technologies Used

Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Version Control: Git
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Postman

## Brief

The backend's main goal was to provide RESTful API endpoints for the frontend to perform CRUD operations on Devil Fruit entries stored in the MongoDB database.

## Planning

### Initial Steps

Before diving into the code, I took some time to plan out the website. This planning stage was crucial for understanding how the website would work, defining its logic, and ensuring a smooth development process.

### Sketches and Diagrams

I used Excalidraw, a collaborative whiteboard tool, to create visual sketches and diagrams that helped me visualize the website's components and user interactions. These sketches allowed me to map out the following key aspects of the website:
